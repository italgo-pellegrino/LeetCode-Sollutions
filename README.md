#LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various coding challenges on LeetCode. Each challenge is in its own file with a descriptive name and a corresponding number. The code is written in C#.
#Getting Started

To run the code in this repository, you'll need to have Visual Studio or a similar development environment installed. You'll also need to have the .NET framework installed.

Once you have everything set up, you can clone this repository to your local machine and open the solution file (LeetCode.sln) in Visual Studio. From there, you can build and run the individual projects to see the solutions in action.
#Structure

Each challenge has its own file with a name that corresponds to the challenge number and a brief description. The code is structured in a way that is easy to read and understand. I've also included comments throughout the code to explain what each section does.
Challenges

Here's a list of the challenges that are included in this repository:

    RomanToInteger.cs: Given a Roman numeral, convert it to an integer.  

Notes

These solutions are not necessarily the most efficient or optimal solutions to each problem. They are simply my own solutions that I came up with while working through the challenges on LeetCode. I welcome any feedback or suggestions for improvement.
