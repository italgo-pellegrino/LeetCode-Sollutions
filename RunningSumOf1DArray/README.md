Sure, here is a shorter `README.md` file:

# Running Sum of 1D Array

This C# program computes the running sum of a one-dimensional integer array. It contains a `RunningSum` method that takes an integer array as an input parameter and returns an integer array containing the running sum of the input array.

To run the program, open the `RunningSumOf1DArray.cs` file in a C# compiler or integrated development environment (IDE), and compile and run the program.

## Example

Here is an example of how to use the `RunningSum` method:

```csharp
int[] runSum = new RunningSumOf1DArray().RunningSum(new int[] { 1, 3, 8 });
// Output: [1, 4, 12]
```
